Cohen Group Rates Folder Readme File
Rates folder compiled July, 2006 by A. Perring
Based on JPL Data Evaluation #15, 2006


- Rates are named with the smaller component first and then alphabetically.
- Coments for individual files include date of last update, source and error 
estimates for parameters where available.
- When multiple pathwawys exist, rates are labeled a,b,c etc.  Check 
comments for description.
- Keq's have been included for those reactions where thermal decomposition 
is known to compete with formation at common atmospheric conditions.
These constants should only be used between 200 and 300K.
- Hydrocarbons with up to three carbon are listed by empirical formula.
Larger HC's are listed by common name.
- Reactions of peroxy and alkoxy radicals larger than three carbons have
not been included as they vary by source and often lack any
